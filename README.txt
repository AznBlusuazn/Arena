ABOUT THIS APPLICATION

This is an arena game that will be completely customizable.  It is a homage to the
old school late 80's-90's RPG games, specifically the turn based battle.  This
game will be completely customizable.  Some of the features will include the
ability to "level up" your chosen character, the NPC players to "level up", and
an option for the game world to develop while not in game play.

This is very early development, not playable at this time.

This game was inspired by the author's kids and their love for arena/simulation
games and the author's enjoyment of late 80's-90's RPG games.
